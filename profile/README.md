[Rebalancer](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/hackmoney2022/rebalancer-1bx2j) will keep your exposure to an given list of assetet "constant" by using AMMs and other DeFi protcols. The idea originates from the idea of [Prism]([Prism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/08/07/cant-invest-in-a-crypto-hedge-fund-diy-with-shapeshifts-prism/)) which was proposed by Shapeshfit "many" years ago, and later [shutdown (waybackmachine)](https://web.archive.org/web/20190208084612/https://info.shapeshift.io/blog/2018/10/11/prism-has-shut-down) by them.

By standing on the shoulders of giants like Uniswap and Aave it's possible to recreate a product like Prism without any trusted third parties. We don't just want to recreate Prism, but build on top of the idea. We want to make it possible to have a fixedd exposoure to other protocols and services like yield protocols, and not just keep the asset exposoure in check.
